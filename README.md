# Ghoomo-Pakistan-Project-ICT
# Introduction
Ghoomo Pakistan was an initiative taken by our university group for our ICT project in Semester 1. It was aimed at promoting tourism in Pakistan by presenting a more positive image of Pakistan, displaying locations with historical and religious significance for people who look forward to visiting the country in the future.

# Description
